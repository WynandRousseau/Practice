Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do your Developer Test.

##### ^^^^ PLEASE RUN npm i on the nearest-user-app and restart VS Code before testing ^^^^ ####

I apologize for not completing the test in full as I am in the process of moving and could not get to all of the Bonus requirements.
The initial setup did not want to work giving Typescript parsing problems , but after a bit of struggle I managed to get that sorted

I struggled to get the Unit tests to work , so I just commented out my attempt. ( first time implementing unit tests )

It was my first time creating the entire api side from scratch. if I had a bit more time , I do believe I would have been able to get it working. I am not unfamiliar with APIs , this was my first try at creating it all from scratch

I spend about 6 hours in total on this. apologies for the code being unclean and not to the standard I would have wanted to give it to you.

I did not add many comments as i always get mixed messages on PRs when adding comments in code.

HotelApi = ASP.Net (bonus question)
nearest-user-app = Vue app ( with failed bonus question)
